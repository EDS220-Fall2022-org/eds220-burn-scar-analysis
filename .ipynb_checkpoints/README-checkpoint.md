# eds220-burn-scar-analysis

In this Jupyter Notebook, we first visualize true color images of the August Complex fire before and after it burned using a dataset from USGS with boundaries of wildfires. Then, the Normalized Burn Ratio (NBR) is used to analyze burn severity, which is a measure of the degree to which a fire has affected the ecosystem. To compare these two images, we will compute the Normalized Difference to show where burn severity most significantly affected the vegetation and soil. Finally, we added a scale to the visualization to show the levels of burn severity from the August Complex fire.
