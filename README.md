# eds220-burn-scar-analysis

Our project uses** satellite imagery from the Sentinel 2 satellites to map and quantify burn severity for the August Complex fire that occurred in Northern California in 2020. Similar to Landsat 8, Sentinel 2 captures bands that can be processed to calculate burn severity of a fire, which shows how much damage the fire did to the ecosystem. Our SentinelNBR.ipynb notebook will go through the following steps: call a pre-made wildfire boundary, produce before and after true color images of the fire, produce before and after false images of the fire to display the normalized difference, show which areas had certain levels of severity, and graph the proportion of levels of severity. This link provides more information on the Sentinel 2 dataset that was used: https://developers.google.com/earth-engine/datasets/catalog/COPERNICUS_S2.
